A free copy is available with this repository.  The dataset displayed was anonymized using Faker to protect personal information and the identity of the insurance carrier. This repository is a work in progress. The code originally used for the thesis was prototype and run on several different computers. Some of the code included in with this repository has been cleaned and put into pipelines; other code is included in original form and will error if you try to run it. I'll continue to update and clean the code over time. There are a number of things that I still hope to experiment with using this dataset, but I'm working several other projects and need to divide my time. 

ABSTRACT

The P&C Small Commercial Insurance industry presents a significant policy retention challenge given the presence of independent intermediaries. Current retention models generally follow traditional relational marketing paradigms and therefore do not account for the complexities introduced by the presence of an independent intermediary. Given an anonymous policy dataset consisting of correlated, high-dimensional, and high-cardinality categorical/numeric data; current data mining methods are used to construct a retention model with practical applications. Additionally, predictive features that capture intermediary-related information are engineered and designated as candidate features. Candidate features are selected for final model inclusion using various data mining approaches to feature importance measurement and feature selection.
